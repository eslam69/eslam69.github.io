# Getting Started with Web Development

Web development is an exciting field that combines creativity with technical skills. In this guide, we'll explore the fundamental concepts and tools you need to begin your journey.

## The Basics

Every web developer should start with these three core technologies:

1. **HTML** - The structure
2. **CSS** - The style
3. **JavaScript** - The functionality

### HTML

HTML (HyperText Markup Language) is the backbone of any website. Here's a simple example:

```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
  <head>
    <title>My First Website</title>
  </head>
  <body>
    <h1>Hello, World!</h1>
  </body>
</html>
```

### CSS

CSS helps make your websites beautiful. Here's a basic example:

```css
body {
  font-family: Arial, sans-serif;
  line-height: 1.6;
  color: #333;
}

h1 {
  color: #0066cc;
}
```
